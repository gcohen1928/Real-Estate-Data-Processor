# Welcome to the REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TOOL 
* I made this because I got sick of calculating all the juicy info when I went deal hunting on real esate listing websites.
* So, run the program, answer the questions that it asks, and it will give you some useful data about homes in your area
* The data output is a little jank as of now. Go to the website it prompts you to (https://codebeautify.org/jsonviewer)and insert the output to see it in a pretty way
* I am working on makin this program a web app so stay tuned

### The program is currently limited at displaying one home in the zip code that you enter.
* If you would like to change this, go to line 89 and change the variable limit to however many homes you want to see. 

# But please do not run this up
* The API's that this program uses restrict use and will charge me for each additional request I make if I go over this limit
